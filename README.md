# MsiPowerCenter
### :warning: **WARNING!** this project is in an early state, it may not work at all on computers other than mine. In any case, even in its final state it will probably just work on MSI computers at best.

### Description
This project is my best try on making a **Linux** application to manage the fans, power consumption and performance on my MSI Prestige 15. The idea comes from the official app **MSI Center for Business & Productivity** which only runs on Windows (thanks MSI). 

#### Credits
I wouldn't have even started if i didn't find this repo: https://github.com/YoyPa/isw where i found this super useful [document](https://github.com/YoyPa/isw/blob/master/wiki/msi%20ec.pdf) that explains how the EC (Embedded Controller) on MSI computers works. 

#### These are some of the features that i plan to implement (sooner or later):
- [ ] Make it work reliably and clean the code
- [ ] Make it more general so that it can work on different MSI computers
- [ ] Do some testing on different MSI computers
- [ ] Add more profiles (at least 4 like the windows software)
- [ ] A simple GUI application to select a profile and change varius paramethers
- [ ] User should be able to create fully customized profiles (using the GUI app)
